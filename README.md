## This is Leonardo.ai API.

This package contains Python API for [Leonardo.ai](https://leonardo.ai/) based on official [API documentation](https://docs.leonardo.ai/reference).

This python API provides access to Leonardo API using synchronous methods (based on requests library) as well as asynchronous (aiohttp). You can choose one of them - `Leonardo` or `LeonardoAsync`.

To start, you must have paid subscription and create an API access token from you [settings page](https://app.leonardo.ai/settings)->User API. Then, init manager class with using your access_token:

```python
    from leonardo_api import Leonardo
    
    leonardo = Leonardo(auth_token='abcd-1234-5678-90ef-deadbeef00000')
```

Now you can use all API methods, provided by Leonardo.ai API, i.e. starting getting user info and generating your first image:

```python
    response = leonardo.get_user_info()  # get your user info
    response = leonardo.post_generations(prompt="The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", num_images=1,
                                               negative_prompt='schrodinger cat paradox',
                                               model_id='e316348f-7773-490e-adcd-46757c738eb7', width=1024, height=768,
                                               guidance_scale=7)
``

In according to API reference, you will get the json answer with content about pending job like following:

```json
    {'sdGenerationJob': {'generationId': '123456-0987-aaaa-bbbb-01010101010'}}
```

To obtain your image you need to use additional method:

```python

    response = leonardo.get_single_generation(generation_id)  # get it using response['sdGenerationJob']['generationId']
```

Or, optionally, you may wait for job completion using following method:

```python
    response = await leonardo.wait_for_image_generation(generation_id=response['sdGenerationJob']['generationId'])
```

Finally, you'll get your array of images:

```python
    [{'url': 'https://cdn.leonardo.ai/users/abcd-1234-5678-90ef-deadbeef00000/generations/123456-0987-aaaa-bbbb-01010101010/Absolute_Reality_v16_The_quick_brown_fox_jumps_0.jpg', 'nsfw': False, 'id': 'aaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-ffffffffff', 'likeCount': 0, 'generated_image_variation_generics': []}]
```

You'll find descriptions for rest of the methods in official [API reference](https://docs.leonardo.ai/reference).
